# WEEK-2 Frontend

This week focuses on mastering core Frontend fundamentals: HTML5, CSS3, Responsive Design, JavaScript ES6, and DOM Manipulation.
By the end of this week, you build multiple small UI components, interactive widgets, and DOM-based mini-projects.

## What I Learned

The first day was about going back to the foundation. I learned how to structure a webpage properly using meaningful HTML tags and how to organize the layout using Flexbox and Grid. It felt like learning how to place each brick of a house in the right spot. By the end of the day, I had a complete layout with a header, hero section, content area, sidebar, and footer. It helped me get comfortable with spacing, alignment, and understanding the flow of a webpage.

## What i Learned

On the second day, I took the layout from Day 1 and transformed it into something that could adapt to different screen sizes. I learned how important mobile responsiveness is and how media queries and flexible units help make a website feel natural on any device. Seeing the layout shift and adjust beautifully on mobile screens felt like magic I could finally understand.


# Day 3

## What i Learned

This day was when things really started becoming interactive. I learned how JavaScript communicates with the HTML structure through the DOM. I practiced using let, const, arrow functions, and JavaScript array methods. I also explored event handling—clicks, key presses, toggles—and built small UI interactions like an accordion, dropdown, modal, and counters. It was the first time I felt like I was actually "controlling" the webpage instead of just designing it.

The fourth day was about building something practical. I created a Todo app that could save tasks even after refreshing the page. This taught me how to work with LocalStorage and how to keep a UI synced with stored data. I learned how to handle tasks like adding, editing, deleting, searching, and clearing—all dynamically. It was a great introduction to building real app-like behavior.

This was the capstone project for the week. I fetched product data from an external API and displayed it on the page. I learned how to handle API responses, show product cards, implement searching, and sort items by price. It felt like building a mini shopping website, and it tied together everything—HTML, CSS, JS—into one interactive experience.
